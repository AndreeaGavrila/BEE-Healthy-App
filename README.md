# Bee-Healthy-App :bee: :honey_pot:

## **Technovation Girls Challenge 2018**
_Equips young women to become tech entrepreneurs and leaders. With the support of volunteer mentors, girls work in teams to code mobile apps that address real-world problems._


- **Team "So called engineers"**
  - We are a company formed of 5 imaginative girls: [@AndreeaGavrila](https://github.com/AndreeaGavrila), [@IrinaMoisa](), [@AnastasiaSmarandi](), [@MirunaTudoreanu](), [@AndreeaButucaru](), who each played a crucial role in the development of the product: Research and Development, Design, Marketing, Production, Accounting and Finance.

- **Our Story:**
  - Hello! We are **_So called engineers_** and this is our application, **BEE HEALTHY!** We aim to increase honey consumption, educate the users about its benefits and facilitate access to natural honey.
  - Through this application we are trying to promote honey and its benefits, as well as facilitate access to natural honey from trusted distributors.
  - We decided to tackle this problem when we discovered just how overlooked honey is.
  - As you can see, Romania is situated on the first place in honey production levels, but unfortunately we are the last country when it comes to consumption.
  - So, we tried to provide an environment that gives means as well as reasons for finding honey and integrating it in your diet immediately.
  - Our application consists of an interactive map with the beekeepers in Romania, an information page about the benefits of honey where you can find articles describing its many uses, a reminder for the two recommended teaspoons of honey and a mini-game to appeal to a younger audience.
  - What our application brings to the market in addition to our competitors is that we provide not only the means to bring more honey in your life, but also the reasons to do so the app is ideal for people dedicated to live a healthier life. It provides professional quality services.
  - Our application is a prototype and we are planning to expand it!


- **General Info:**
  - Project developed in MIT (Google) App Inventor
   
  - _MIT App Inventor_ is an online platform designed to teach computational thinking concepts through development of mobile applications. Students create applications by dragging and dropping components into a design view and using a visual blocks language to program application behavior.
